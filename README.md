# ToP-RockPaperScissors

This is a basic version of Rock Paper Scissors player in the console.  There is a function to randomly generate a computer selection, a function to play a round of Rock Paper Scissors with a chosen player selection and random computer selection, and a function which plays 5 rounds and keeps score and declares a winner/loser at the end.  

I will improve this project in the future and add styling and improve the logic as I continue my studies.
